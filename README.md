# why assembly?
its cool i guess

# how to compile in windows:

install [this](https://www.nasm.org/)

and install [this](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

then do these commands

`nasm -fwin32 main.asm`

`gcc main.obj`

`.\a.exe`


# how to compile in linux or similer
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

you can try to port it over but i dont know how to do that. this is a win32 app so you would probably have to remake the program with linux system calls
